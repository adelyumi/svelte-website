        <p>I was born on January 5, 2004.</p>
        <p>
            At school I was always interested in math. Starting from the 5th
            grade I actively participated in various olympiads and conferences
            and won prizes in several of them! I consider the most important
            award in the international competition
            <a id="isef" href="https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/">ISEF</a
            >where I presented my work in the category of mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 9th grade, I started getting interested in IT. I became attracted
            by the number of fascinating spheres and the opportunity to apply
            mathematics in practice. At the end of 11th grade, I made the
            decision to enter a modern IT university, Innopolis.

            I am currently in my 3rd trimester of my 1st year. During studying I
            met new interesting people, developed soft skills and learned a lot
            of useful information. My learning is just continuing, which means
            that there are a lot of exciting experiences ahead of me!
